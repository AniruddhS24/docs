Evaluate agent responses using Playgent's comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics. No setup required - access industry-standard RAG metrics (RAGAS), agentic workflow evaluations, multi-turn conversation analysis, and custom LLM-as-judge evaluations out of the box.

## 🎯 Built-in Evaluation Metrics

Playgent offers **27 evaluation metrics** across five categories:

### Custom Evaluations

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Can you help me with my taxes?",
    "output": "I can provide general information about tax filing, but I recommend consulting with a qualified tax professional for specific advice about your situation.",
    "scorers": [
      "bias",
      "toxicity",
      "non_advice",
      "pii_leakage",
      "role_violation"
    ]
  }'
```

```python Python
evaluation = client.evaluate(
    input="Can you help me with my taxes?",
    output="I can provide general information, but consult a tax professional for specific advice.",
    scorers=["bias", "toxicity", "non_advice", "pii_leakage", "role_violation"]
)

# All safety checks
for scorer, result in evaluation.results.items():
    if not result.pass:
        print(f"⚠️ {scorer} failed: {result.reasoning}")
```

</RequestExample>

## Notes

- **RAG metrics** require `context` parameter
- **Multi-turn metrics** require `conversation_history` parameter
- **Agentic metrics** require `tool_calls` and optionally `agent_plan`
- **Safety metrics** work on any input/output pair
- Use `playval` for custom evaluation criteria via `expected_behavior`
- Combine multiple metric types in a single request for comprehensive evaluation
