## What is an Event?

An **event** is any LLM call or tool call made by your agent. Events are **automatically captured** within functions decorated with `@record` - you don't need to manually log anything.

Think of events like a detailed log of everything your agent does - from the initial function call to each LLM interaction.

<Note>
  The `@record` decorator should be used on the function that defines the
  entrypoint for your agent - the main function that orchestrates your agent's
  behavior.
</Note>

## Event Types

Playgent automatically captures two types of events:

### Input Events

Input events capture the arguments passed to functions decorated with `@record`:

```python
@record
def my_agent(user_input: str, context: dict):
    # This creates an input event capturing:
    # - user_input
    # - context
    response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
    return response

# When called, this captures an input event
my_agent(user_input="Hello", context={"user_id": 123})
```

The input event records the function name and all arguments passed to it.

### LLM Call Events

LLM call events capture interactions:

```python
# This creates an LLM call event
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    temperature=0.7
)
```

The LLM call event records:

- The model used
- Messages and prompts
- Generation parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
- The response from the API
- Token usage statistics

### Tool Call Events

Tool call events capture when your agent uses OpenAI function calling:

```python
# When the LLM decides to call a tool, a tool call event is created
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Add milk to my list"}],
    tools=[{
        "type": "function",
        "name": "add_to_list",
        "description": "Add item to list"
    }]
)

# If the model returns a tool call, it's captured as a tool call event
```

## Viewing Events

Events are automatically displayed in the Playgent dashboard where you can:

- See the complete timeline of a session
- Inspect individual event details
- Understand the agent's execution flow
- Identify errors or unexpected behavior
