## Installation

First, install Playgent via pip:

```bash
pip install playgent
```

## Step 1: Create an API key

Go to the [Playgent dashboard](https://playgent-dashboard.vercel.app) and create an API key.

1. Click on the "Account" button in the bottom left corner.
2. Click on the "API Keys" tab.
3. Click on the "Create API Key" button.
4. Copy the API key and save it to a secure location.

## Step 2: Instrument your agent

Wrap your LLM client and add the `@record` decorator to your agent functions to automatically track all interactions.

Here's the basic pattern:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from playgent import record, wrap_openai

client = wrap_openai(OpenAI(), api_key="<PLAYGENT-API-KEY>")

@record
def inference(user_input: str):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

That's it! The `@record` decorator marks the function as a Playgent trace. The `wrap_openai()` function will automatically track all OpenAI calls made using the wrapped client. This allows you to easily use other libraries with no vendor lock-in.

<Note>
  You can also use the `PLAYGENT_API_KEY` environment variable to set the API
  key.

## Step 2: View traces and spans on the dashboard

Once your agent is instrumented, all traces and spans will appear in the [Playgent dashboard](https://playgent-dashboard.vercel.app)

The dashboard provides:

- **Automatic issue detection** - Playgent analyzes each trace to identify problems
- **Issue clustering** - Similar issues are grouped together for easy prioritization
- **Trace visualization** - See the full execution flow with all spans and events
- **User interaction insights** - Understand exactly how users are interacting with your agent
