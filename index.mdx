# Playgent

Playgent is an agent testing library that helps you record and test your OpenAI agent sessions. Build reliable AI agents with confidence by capturing real interactions and replaying them as tests.

## Quick Start

Get started with Playgent in four simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Instrument your agent" icon="code">
    Add the `@record` decorator to track all OpenAI calls automatically. [See
    Step 1](/quickstart#step-1-instrument-your-agent-to-record-sessions)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Test Case" icon="flask">
    Use the dashboard to turn recorded sessions into test cases. [See Step
    2](/quickstart#step-2-create-a-test-case)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Demonstrate a run" icon="chart-line">
    Review and annotate sessions with expected outcomes. [See Step
    3](/quickstart#step-3-demonstrate-a-run)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run tests via replay" icon="rotate">
    Replay test cases and verify your agent behaves correctly. [See Step
    4](/quickstart#step-4-run-tests-via-replay)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Playgent?

Testing AI agents is challenging because their behavior can be non-deterministic and difficult to validate. Playgent solves this by:

- **Capturing real interactions** - Record actual agent sessions as they happen
- **Easy annotation** - Define expected behaviors through an intuitive dashboard
- **Reliable replay** - Test against real scenarios, not mocked data
- **Catch regressions** - Ensure agent updates don't break existing functionality
